Understanding what this notation is, how it works, and how to manipulate them is a valuable skill to learn for use in almost any area of mathematics.\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- *Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read GUIDE and GUIDE* -->\n\n# What is sigma notation? {-}\n\nIf you want to add many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where **sigma notation** comes in. (USES!)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of sum and sigma notation\n\nA **sum** is any addition of two or more real numbers. If $a_k,a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n$ are real numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are some natural numbers with $k\\leq N$), then you can use **sigma notation** to write their sum as $$a_k + a_{k+1} + \\ldots + a_N = \\sum_{i = k}^N a_i$$ where the right hand side reads 'the sum from $i = k$ to $i = n$ of the elements $a_i$'. The symbol $i$ is known as the **index** of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.\n:::\n\n#### Examples {-}\n\nHere's some examples of sigma notation.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nWhat is the value of $\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i$?\n\n  You can use the definition above to write this out as a sum and then calculate it: $$\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +9 + 10 = 55.$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\nWhat is the value of $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2$?\n    \n  Before tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, $$\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}$$ This translates to $$\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2$$ and $2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\nWhat is the value of $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^N n = S$?\n\n  In this case, you're being asked to find $S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + N$. The following method is due to [Gauss](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gauss/), who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).\n\n  First of all, you can reorder $S$ to write that $S = N + (N-1) + \\ldots + 2 + 1$. Adding two lots of $S$ together gives the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \\ldots & + & N \\\\\n+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \\ldots & + & 1\\\\\\hline\n& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \\ldots & + & (N+1)\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n  Therefore, $2S$ is $N$ lots of $(N+1)$; you can write this as $2S = N(N+1)$. Dividing both sides by $2$ gives $S = N(N+1)/2$.\n\n:::\n\n## Writing sums using sigma notation\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to do the opposite of the above. That is, given a sequence of numbers, you will learn how to write their sum using sigma notation. The crux of this process is to recognise a pattern in the sequence of given numbers. It's best to learn this using examples.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nWrite $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12$ using sigma notation.\n    \n  You can tell that these are the first six multiples of $2$; so you can list these elements as $2n$ for $n = 1$ up to $n = 6$. Therefore, you can write that $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = \\sum_{n=1}^6 2n.$$\n    \n:::\n   \n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"} \n## Example 5\nWrite $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32$ using sigma notation.\n\n  These are the first 6 numbers in the sequence $2^n$ for $n=0$ up to $n=5$. Therefore, you can write $$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = \\sum_{n=0}^5 2^n.$$\n  \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nWrite $-1 + 2 -3 + 4 - 5$ using sigma notation.\n\n  For these types of sequences it's useful to keep in mind the sequence $(-1)^n$, which alternates between $1$ and $-1$. Hence, you can write these elements as $(-1)^nn$ for $n=1$ up to $n=5$. Using sigma notation, it will look like this: $$\\sum_{n=1}^5 (-1)^nn.$$\n\n:::   \n## Properties\n\nIn this section you will learn about a few properties of sigma notation which means you'll have a toolkit to rearrange sums!\n\nThe first property you'll learn about sigma notation is *distribuitivity*. This property allows you to take constants from inside the sigma notation to outside the summation.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Distribuitivity\n\n  Let $a_k,a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n$ be a sequence of numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are integers with $k \\leq n$) and $C$ be any constant. Then $$\\sum_{i=k}^n Ca_i = C \\sum_{i=k}^n a_i.$$ \n\n:::\n\nYou can see this is true by writing the entire sum out, like this: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\sum_{i=k}^nCa_i &=& Ca_k + Ca_{k+1} + Ca_{k+2} + \\ldots + Ca_n \\\\ \n&=& C(a_k + a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + \\ldots + a_n) \\\\ \n&=& C\\sum_{i=k}^n a_k \n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\n  What is the value of $\\sum_{n=2}^56n^2$?\n  \n  Using distributivity, $\\sum_{n=2}^56n^2 = 6\\sum_{n=2}^5n^2$. From Example 2, you know that $\\sum_{n=2}^5n^2 = 54$. Therefore, $6\\sum_{n=2}^5n^2 = 6 \\times 54 = 324$.\n:::\n\nAnother property of sigma notation is something we'll call *combining sums*. This lets you write two sums in sigma notation as one sum.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Combining sums\n\n  Let $a_k,a_{k+1},\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_k,b_{k+1},\\ldots,b_{n}$ be two sequences of numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are numbers with $k \\leq n$). Then $$\\sum_{i=k}^na_i + \\sum_{i=k}^n b_i = \\sum_{i=k}^n(a_i + b_i)$$ and $$\\sum_{i=k}^na_i - \\sum_{i=k}^n b_i = \\sum_{i=k}^n(a_i - b_i).$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n  Note in the property above that both sequences start at $k$ and end at $n$.\n  \n:::\n\nSimilar to the distributive property, you can show this is true by writing the entire sum out: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl} \n\\sum_{i=k}^na_i + \\sum_{i=k}^n b_i &=& (a_{k} + a_{k+1} + \\ldots + a_n) + (b_k + b_{k+1} + \\ldots + b_n) \\\\ & = & (a_k + b_k) + (a_{k+1} + b_{k+1}) + \\ldots + (a_n + b_n) \\\\[0.5em] & = & \\sum_{i=k}^n (a_k + b_k).\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn a similar way, you can show that $\\sum_{i=k}^n a_i - \\sum_{i=k}^n b_i = \\sum_{i=k}^n(a_i-b_i)$ is also true.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 8\n\n  Write $\\sum_{n=1}^62n + \\sum_{n=0}^52^n$ as a single sum.\n  \n  First, notice that the indices of these sequences are different, so before you can use the combining sums property you need to do a process called *reindexing*. Reindexing a sum in sigma notation means rewriting the same sum using different indicies. For your purposes, you can reindex $\\sum_{n=1}^6 2n$ as $\\sum_{n=0}^5 (2n+2)$. You can now use the combining sums property: $$\\sum_{n=1}^62n + \\sum_{n=0}^52^n = \\sum_{n=0}^5 (2n+2) + \\sum_{n=0}^52^n = \\sum_{n=0}^5 (2n + 2^n + 2).$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n  In the above example, you could also reindex $\\sum_{n=0}^52^n$ instead of $\\sum_{n=1}^62n$. Give it a go!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Splitting a sum\n\n  Let $a_k,a_{k+1},\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_k,b_{k+1},\\ldots,b_{n}$ be two sequences of numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are integers with $k < n-1$). Then for any integer $m$ such that $k \\leq m < n$, $$\\sum_{i=k}^n a_i = \\sum_{i=k}^m a_i + \\sum_{i=m+1}^n a_i.$$\n\n:::\n\nAgain, similar to above you can show this by writing the entire sum out. This is left to you. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 9\n\nWrite $\\sum_{i=10}^{100}i$ as the product of three sums.\n\nThere are a large number of ways to do this an example of which is: \n\n$$\\sum_{i=10}^{11} i + \\sum_{i=12}^{98} i + \\sum_{i=99}^{100} i.$$\nNote that this example has not been particularly useful mathematically but is to illustrate the property in action. \n\nThis property is used more when working with infinite summations.\n\n:::\n\n## Double sums\n\nSometimes, you'll want to multiply two sums together. This can be written succinctly using something called *double sums*.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Double sums\n\n  Let $a_{k},a_{k+1},\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_t,b_{t+1},\\ldots,b_m$ be two sequences of numbers (where $k,n,t$, and $m$ are integers with $k \\leq n$ and $t \\leq m$). Then the **double sum** $\\sum_{i=k}^n\\sum_{j=t}^m a_i b_j$ is defined as\n  \n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\sum_{i=k}^n\\sum_{j=t}^m a_i b_j &=& a_kb_t + a_kb_{t+1} + \\ldots + a_kb_m + a_{k+1}b_t + a_{k+1}b_{t+1}\\\\ \n& & \\qquad+ \\ldots + a_{k+1}b_m + \\ldots + a_nb_m.\n\\end{array}\n$$  \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n  You might find it easier to remember the above by thinking of $\\sum_{i=k}^n\\sum_{j=t}^m a_i b_j$ as $a_1(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j) + a_2(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j) + \\ldots + a_n(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j).$\n:::\n\nYou will now see how this relates to multiplying two sums together. Suppose that $a_k,a_{k+1},\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_t,b_{t+1},\\ldots,b_m$ are like above, and consider the product $(\\sum_{i=k}^na_i)(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j)$. Writing it all out and performing the multiplication, you get \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\left(\\sum_{i=k}^na_i\\right)\\left(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j\\right) &=& (a_k+a_{k+1}+\\ldots+a_n)(b_t + b_{t+1}+\\ldots+b_m) \\\\ &=& a_kb_t + a_kb_{t+1} + \\ldots + a_kb_m + a_{k+1}b_t + a_{k+1}b_{t+1} + \\\\ & &\\quad\\quad \\ldots + a_{k+1}b_m + a_{k+2}b_t + \\ldots + a_nb_m \\\\[0.5em] &=& \\sum_{i=k}^n\\sum_{j=t}^m a_i b_j\n\\end{array}\n$$ \n\nYou can write this as a result:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Double sums and products of two sums\n  Let $a_{k},a_{k+1},\\ldots,a_n$ and $b_t,b_{t+1},\\ldots,b_m$ be two sequences of numbers (where $k,n,t$, and $m$ are integers with $k \\leq n$ and $t \\leq m$). Then $$\\sum_{i=k}^n\\sum_{j=t}^m a_i b_j = (\\sum_{i=k}^na_i)(\\sum_{j=t}^mb_j).$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 10\n\nWrite $(1+2+3+4+5+6)(2+4+6+8+10+12)$ as a double sum and as a product of two sums.\n\nFirst, notice you can write out the above expression in the form $(1)(2) + (1)(4) + ... (1)(12) + (2)(2) + (2)(4) ... (3)(2) + ...(6)(12)$ \n\nFrom the definition above you may now rewrite the expression to the double sum \n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^6\\sum_{j=1}^6 i*2j$$\nusing the distrubitivity property this can be written as $$2\\sum_{i=1}^6\\sum_{j=1}^6 ij$$\n\nThis can then be written using the product of two sums rule above to $$2\\sum_{i=1}^6i\\sum_{j=1}^6j$$\n\nIt is evident that the two sums are the same with different index variables this means that they can be combined to form $$2\\sum_{k=1}^6k^2$$ \n\n$k$ has been used to differentiate the new sum from the ones involving $i$ and $j$ before but as always the choice of index variable is relatively unimportant\n\n:::\n\n## Quick check problems {-}\n\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n1.
