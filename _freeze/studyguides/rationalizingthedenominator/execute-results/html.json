This study guide also covers the topic of quadratic conjugates which are sometimes used to rationalize the denominator of a fraction.\ncategories:\n  - Algebra\n  - Key Skills\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd) and [Guide: Expanding Brackets](expandingthebrackets.qmd). The only irrational numbers you will see in this guide are are square roots, if you want to learn more about irraional numbers, have a look at the [Guide: Number Theory](numbertheory.qmd).*\n\n# What is rationalizing the denominator? {-}\n\nWhen you rationalize the denominator, you rewrite a fraction so that the denominator contains no square roots or other irrational numbers.\n\nFor example, in the fraction $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the denominator contains a square root, which is irrational. You want to rewrite the fraction so that it looks like this: $\\dfrac{3\\sqrt2}{2}$ where the numerator can be irrational, but the denominator is free of square roots and a rational number, in this case 2.\n\nThis process is helpful for doing operations like addition or subtraction on the fraction and can also be useful when trying to approximate such a fraction.\n\n::: {#definition-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Note\n\nWhen you rewrite fractions you might multiply the numerator and denominator by the same value $k$ where $k$ is any number. When you are doing this, you are multiplying the fraction by $\\dfrac{k}{k}$ which is the same as multiplying the fraction by $1$.\n\nYou are therefore not changing the value of the fraction, you are rewriting it.\n\n:::\n\n# Expressions of the form $\\frac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}}$ {-}\n\nFor fractions like $\\dfrac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}}$, where a is any number and b and c are integers, you rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the square root in the denominator: $\\sqrt{c}$. This gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{c}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{c}}{b(\\sqrt{c})^2}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator gives you\n\n$$\n\\frac{a\\sqrt{c}}{bc}\n$$\n\nThe denominator is now rational and free of square roots as $b$ and $c$ are integers so $bc$ is also an integer. Example 1 shows you how to rationalize the fraction you saw above: $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ by rationalizing the denominator:\n\nTo rationalize this, you multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$, giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt2)^2}\n$$\n\nSimplifying gives you: $\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}}$ by rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$, giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2(\\sqrt5)^2}\n$$\n\nSimplifying gives you: $\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{5}}{10}$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{5+\\sqrt{2}}{7\\sqrt{3}}$ by rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$, giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{5+\\sqrt{2}}{7\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(5 + \\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}}{7(\\sqrt{3})^2}\n$$\n[Expanding the brackets](expandingthebrackets.qmd) and simplifying then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}}{7(3)} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{21}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n# What is a quadratic conjugate? {-}\n\n::: {#definition-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a quadratic conjugate\n\nGiven an expression of the form $b + c\\sqrt{d}$, where $b$, $c$ and $d$ are integers, the quadratic conjugate is the expression with the same terms but with the opposite sign in front of the term with a square root.\n\nThe quadratic conjugate of the expression $b + c\\sqrt{d}$ is therefore $b - c\\sqrt{d}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nWhat is the quadratic conjugate of $7 + 2\\sqrt{3}$:\n\n$$\n7 - 2\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nWhat is the quadratic conjugate of $- 2 - 3\\sqrt{5}$:\n\n$$\n-2 + 3\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5} - 2\n$$\n\n:::\n\nThese conjugates are useful for eliminating square roots when rationalizing denominators of a particular form. Multiplying an expression by its quadratic conjugate eliminates the square root. You can see this when you multiply $b + c\\sqrt{d}$ by its quadratic conjugate to get\n\n$$\n(b + c\\sqrt{d})(b - c\\sqrt{d}) = b^2 - bc\\sqrt{d} + bc\\sqrt{d} - (c\\sqrt{d})^2\n$$\n\nSimplifying this gives you\n\n$$\nb^2 - c^2d\n$$\n\nThis result is rational, free of square roots.\n\n# Expressions of the form $\\frac{a}{b + c\\sqrt{d}}$ {-}\n\nHere a is any number and b, c and d are integers. In this case, rationalizing the denominator involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the quadratic conjugate of ${b + c\\sqrt{d}}$, which would be $b - c\\sqrt{d}$. As you saw above, the denominator will become $b^2 - c^2d$. The entire fraction therefore becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b + c\\sqrt{d}} \\cdot \\frac{b - c\\sqrt{d}}{b - c\\sqrt{d}} = \\frac{a(b - c\\sqrt{d})}{b^2 - c^2d}\n$$\n\nAs you can see, the denominator is now $b^2 - c^2d$ and has been successfully rationalized.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{2}{7 + 2\\sqrt{5}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.
