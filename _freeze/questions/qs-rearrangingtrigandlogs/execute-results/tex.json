It's intended to be completed after having read that, and there is an answer sheet to match this question set. Note that answers are vague, as questions are based off of examples in the guide.\ndraft: true\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**THIS MATERIAL IS PLANNED TO BE SPLIT INTO TWO GUIDES. (1) SOLVING TRIGONOMETRIC EQUATIONS (2) SOLVING LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS.**\n\n*Before attempting these questions, it is highly recommended that you read the guide 'Introduction to rearranging equations with trig and logs' *\n\n## Q1 {-}\n\nSolve each of these equations assuming we are using radians as our angle unit.\n\n1.1 $sin(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}$ \n\n1.2 $cos(2x+1)=\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n1.3 $tan(5x-1)=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}$\n\n1.4 $cos(x^2+4x+3)=1$\n\n## Q2 {-}\n\nUsing that $1+\\cot^2(x)=\\csc^2(x)$, prove that $\\sin^2(x)+\\cos^2(x)=1$.\n\n## Q3 {-}\n\nSolve $5\\cos(x)+9\\sin(x)= 10$ by expressing in the form $R\\sin(x+\\theta)$.\n\n## Q4 {-}\n\n$\\log_a(b)=c$ Label a, b, and c in the following\n\n4.1 $\\log_6(36)=2$\n\n4.2 $3^7=2187$\n\n4.3 $e^x=y$\n\n4.4 $2\\log_2(3)=3.17...$\n\n4.5 $2\\log_2(2)=2$\n\n## Q5 {-}\n\nSolve these logarithmic equations\n\n5.1 $6\\log_3(x)+\\log_3(5)=9$ \n\n5.2 $\\log_2{16x}=6$\n\n5.3 $e^{\\ln(3x)}=y$ Find y in terms of x.\n\n## Q6 {-}\n\nSolve these simultaneous equations\n$$2^y=4x-7$$\nand $$\\log_2(x)=y$$\n\n## Q7\n\nSolve these equations to 3sf\n\n7.1 $e^{-x}+3e^x=12$\n\n7.2 $4e^(x)+e^{-x}=9$\n\n## Q8 {-}\n\n8.1 $\\log_{16}(x)=\\log_2(y)$ Represent y in terms of x.\n\n8.2 $\\log_{3}(x)=\\log_{27}(y)$ Represent y in terms of x.\n\n8.3 $log_9(x)+log_3(2x)=6$ Solve for x.\n",
