## What is sigma notation? {-}

If you want to add infinitely many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where **sigma notation** comes in.

## Definition of sum and sigma notation

A **sum** is any addition of two or more real numbers. If $a_k,a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n$ are real numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are some natural numbers with $k\leq N$), then you can use **sigma notation** to write their sum as $$a_k + a_{k+1} + \ldots + a_N = \sum_{i = k}^N a_i$$ where the right hand side reads 'the sum from $i = k$ to $i = n$ of the elements $a_i$'. The symbol $i$ is known as the **index** of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.

#### Examples {-}

Here's some examples of sigma notation.

(b) What is the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2$?
    
    Before tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, $$\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}$$ This translates to $$\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2$$ and $2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54$.

(c) What is the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^N n = S$?

In this case, you're being asked to find $S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + N$. The following method is due to [Gauss](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gauss/), who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).

First of all, you can reorder $S$ to write that $S = N + (N-1) + \ldots + 2 + 1$. Adding two lots of $S$ together gives the following:

$$
\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \ldots & + & N \\
+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \ldots & + & 1\\\hline
& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \ldots & + & (N+1)
\end{array}
$$

Therefore, $2S$ is $N$ lots of $(N+1)$; you can write this as $2S = N(N+1)$. Dividing both sides by $2$ gives $S = N(N+1)/2$.

## Writing sums using sigma notation

(a) Write $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12$ using sigma notation.
    
    You can tell that these are the first six multiples of $2$; so you can list these elements as $2n$ for $n = 1$ up to $n = 6$. Therefore, you can write that $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = \sum_{n=1}^6 2n.$$

## Additional sums

A **sum** is any addition of two or more real numbers. If $a_k,a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n$ are real numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are some natural numbers with $k\leq N$), then you can use **sigma notation** to write their sum as $$a_k + a_{k+1} + \ldots + a_N = \sum_{i = k}^N a_i$$ where the right hand side reads 'the sum from $i = k$ to $i = n$ of the elements $a_i$'. The symbol $i$ is known as the **index** of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.
