This template shows how instructors can easily create interactive web documents that students can use in self-guided learning.\nThe {webexercises} package provides a number of functions that you use in inline R code or through code chunk options to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given below. Render this file to HTML to see how it works.\nNOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser."

    "text": "Q4\n4.1. By the laws of vector addition, \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{AO} + \\overrightarrow{OB} = -\\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{OB}\\), where \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are the respective coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) written in vector form. We can solve for \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) by solving the above equation. \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2-3\\\\5-4\\\\7-5\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-5\\\\1\\\\2\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n4.2.\\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{pmatrix}4\\\\6\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = \\begin{pmatrix}-2\\\\-4\\\\-5\\end{pmatrix}\\). \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\begin{pmatrix}6\\\\10\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\). You can also calculate this by noticing \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\overrightarrow{CA} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{CB}\\). Then \\(\\overrightarrow{CB} = \\begin{pmatrix}6-0\\\\11-1\\\\7-2\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}6\\\\10\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\)as required\n4.3. Let \\(\\lambda\\) be a real scalar. \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\lambda\\overrightarrow{BC}\\). \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\-5\\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{BC} = \\begin{pmatrix}4k-12\\\\3k-4\\end{pmatrix}\\). This gives you the simultaneous equations \\(\\begin{cases} 10 = \\lambda(4k-12)\\\\-5 = \\lambda(3k-4) \\end{cases}\\). Solving this gives \\(k = 2\\).\n4.4. \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{OA}\\). \\(\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\5\\\\9\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\\\a_2\\\\a_3\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}6\\\\7\\\\-2\\end{pmatrix}\\).

This gives you the simultaneous equations \\(\\begin{cases} 2\\lambda + 3\\mu = 13\\\\3\\lambda -5\\mu = -9 \\end{cases}\\). Solving this gives \\(\\mu = 3\\), \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Which gives the answer \\(2\\mathbf{a} + 3\\mathbf{b}\\).\n4.6. \\(2\\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\5\\\\\\gamma\\end{pmatrix} + 3\\begin{pmatrix}-1\\\\-3\\\\4\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\\beta\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}\\). Solving this gives \\(\\alpha = 3\\),\\(\\beta = 1\\) and \\(\\gamma = -6\\).\n4.7. Let \\(\\lambda\\) be a real scalar. \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\lambda \\mathbf{b}\\). This gives the simultaneous equations \\(\\begin{cases} k - 7 = -2\\lambda\\\\5k+1 = 8\\lambda \\end{cases}\\). Solving this gives \\(k = 3\\).\n4.8. This gives the simultaneous equations \\(\\begin{cases} 5\\alpha + 5 = 2\\alpha -2\\\\3-\\beta = 3\\beta + 8\\\\7-2 = \\gamma + 12\\\\1+5 = 2\\delta + 2\\delta\\end{cases}\\).

    "text": "What is sigma notation?\nIf you want to add infinitely many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where sigma notation comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of sum and sigma notation\n\n\n\nA sum is any addition of two or more real numbers. If \\(a_k,a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n\\) are real numbers (where \\(k\\) and \\(n\\) are some natural numbers with \\(k\\leq N\\)), then you can use sigma notation to write their sum as \\[a_k + a_{k+1} + \\ldots + a_N = \\sum_{i = k}^N a_i\\] where the right hand side reads ‘the sum from \\(i = k\\) to \\(i = n\\) of the elements \\(a_i\\)’. The symbol \\(i\\) is known as the index of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.\n\n\n\nExamples\nHere’s some examples of sigma notation.\n\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\)?\nBefore tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}\\] This translates to \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2\\] and \\(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54\\).\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^N n = S\\)?\n\nIn this case, you’re being asked to find \\(S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + N\\). The following method is due to Gauss, who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).\nFirst of all, you can reorder \\(S\\) to write that \\(S = N + (N-1) + \\ldots + 2 + 1\\). Adding two lots of \\(S\\) together gives the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \\ldots & + & N \\\\\n+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \\ldots & + & 1\\\\\\hline\n& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \\ldots & + & (N+1)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(2S\\) is \\(N\\) lots of \\((N+1)\\); you can write this as \\(2S = N(N+1)\\). Dividing both sides by \\(2\\) gives \\(S = N(N+1)/2\\)."

    "text": "What are Logarithms?\nIn the same way that subtraction ‘undoes’ addition, and division ‘undoes’ multiplication, you can think of the logarithm as the function that ‘undoes’ exponentiation. Logarithms are useful because they essentially let you work backwards through a calculation by undoing exponential effects. Furthermore, logarithms allow us to express large numbers in a convenient way, as well as model various phenomena as they occur in a logarithmic fashion. An example would be a hot object cooling down; this decays logarithmically.\nIn this guide, you will learn the definition of a logarithm, the laws concerning logarithms, what the natural logarithm is and finally, how to change the base of a logarithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a logarithm\n\n\n\nIn its simplest form, a logarithm answers “How many of one number multiply together to make another number.” This is what motivates the following definition:\n\\[ a^x = b\\] or\n\\[\\log_a(b) = x \\] where \\(a &gt; 1\\), and \\(b &gt; 0\\).\n\\(x\\) is known as the exponent, \\(a\\) is the base and \\(b\\) is the argument. You would read the equation above as “logarithm of \\(b\\) to the base \\(a\\) is equal to \\(x\\).”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that the logarithm function can only evaluate real, positive numbers. Therefore, you can’t compute the logarithm of any number that is lesser than or equal to \\(0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nSuppose you are given the equation \\(\\log_{10}(1000) = x\\), and you need to find \\(x\\). You can rewrite the equation as \\(10^x = 1000\\), and from here, you can see that \\(x = 3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nNow consider the equation \\(\\log_x(8) = 3\\). Rewriting this, you can see that this is equal to \\(x^3 = 8\\). Therefore \\(x = 2\\).\n\n\nGenerally, if the base is not specified, it is assumed that the base is 10. For example, \\(\\log(a) = b\\) means that the logarithm of \\(a\\) to the base \\(10\\) is equal to \\(b\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nConsider the equation from Example 1. This can be rewritten as \\(\\log(1000) = x\\), and the solution for \\(x\\) is once again \\(x = 3\\)\n\n\nThat being said, it is good practice to always specify the base of the logarithm you’re using.\nFollowing from the definition, you can make two key observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInverse of a logarithm\n\n\n\n\\[\\log_b(b^k) = k\\] The logarithm of an exponential where the base is equal to the base of the logarithm is equal to the exponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInverse of an exponent\n\n\n\n\\[b^{log_b(k)} = k\\] Raising a logarithm of a number to its own base is equal to the number itself.\n\n\nThe results above can be proved using the definition of the logarithm."

    "text": "Vectors In Three-Dimensional Space\nA vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) can be expressed in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space through various coordinate systems. You will see the standard cartesian coordinate system in this guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Of Unit Vectors:\n\n\n\nUnit vectors are vectors whose magnitude is exactly \\(1\\). They are represented as \\(\\hat{a}\\), with a cap or a hat over its head. Consider the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), then the unit vector of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is defined as:\n\\(\\hat{a}=\\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{|\\mathbf{a}|}\\)\n\nWhere the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is divided by its magnitude.\n\n\n\nParallel Vectors: Vectors having the same unit vector are known as parallel vectors. They can be expressed as scalar multiples of one another.\n\nIn a three-dimensional space, \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\hat{j}\\), \\(\\hat{k}\\) are the unit vectors along the \\(x\\)-axis, \\(y\\)-axis and \\(z\\)-axis respectively. These are also written like \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\) and any vector in the cartesian coordinate system can be generally represented in terms of this.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\) unit vectors along their respective axis.\n\n\nAny vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) can be expressed in the format\n\\(\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\)\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the coefficient of the vector along the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\)-direction, \\(y\\) is the coefficient along the \\(\\mathbf{j}\\)-direction, and \\(z\\) is the coefficient along the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)-direction.\nHere, a positive \\(x\\) is along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, whereas the vectors towards the negative \\(x\\)-axis would have a negative \\(x\\) value. The same is true for the other two axis as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector \\(\\mathbf{a}=2\\mathbf{i}+5\\mathbf{j}+4\\mathbf{k}\\) , this means that the vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) is a free vector with \\(2\\) units along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(5\\) units along the positive \\(y\\)-axis and \\(4\\) units along the positive \\(z\\)-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=-7\\mathbf{k}+3\\mathbf{i}\\), this means that the vector \\(\\vec{b}\\) is a free vector with \\(3\\) units along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(0\\) units along the \\(y\\)-axis and \\(7\\) units along the negative \\(z\\)-axis. This means that the vector lies in the \\(x-z\\) plane, making it a two-dimensional vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector \\(\\mathbf{c}=25\\mathbf{i}\\), this means that the vector \\(\\vec{c}\\) has direction only along the positive \\(x\\)-axis with a magnitude of \\(25\\). This a one-dimensional vector.\n\n\n\nColumn Vectors\nThis is another way of representing vectors. A column vector is a vector whose components are listed vertically in a single column. So, a vector \\(\\vec{a}\\) can be written as:\n\\(\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}=\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\nYou are given the vector \\(\\mathbf{l}=3\\mathbf{i}-4\\mathbf{j}+5\\mathbf{k}\\), to represent this vector in column notation you make a \\(3 \\times 1\\) matrix with entries \\(3,-4\\) and \\(5\\) respectively. So, \\(\\mathbf{l}=3\\mathbf{i}-4\\mathbf{j}+5\\mathbf{k}=\\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\-4\\\\5\\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nTo find if the vector in Example 9 and \\(\\mathbf{d}=\\begin{pmatrix}6\\\\-8\\\\10\\end{pmatrix}\\) are parallel or not, you check if the corresponding coefficients have the same ratio.\nSince \\(\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{-4}{-8}=\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{1}{2}\\), these two vectors have the same ratio of \\(1:2\\), hence, \\(\\mathbf{l}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) are parallel to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n\nTo express the vector \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\begin{pmatrix}7\\\\1\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\), you can write \\(\\mathbf{B}=\\begin{pmatrix}7\\\\1\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}=7\\mathbf{i}+\\mathbf{j}+4\\mathbf{k}\\)\n\n\n\nPosition Vectors, denoted \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), are vectors that indicate the position of a body.\nConsider a point \\(P\\) in space, having coordinates \\((x,y,z)\\) with respect to the origin \\(O(0,0,0)\\), the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{OP}\\) is the position vector for the point \\(P\\). So,\n\\(\\mathbf{r}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\), for the point P.\nThen the magnitude of the position vector \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is given by \\(|\\mathbf{r}|=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The position vector for the point \\(P\\) with respect to the origin\n\n\nAny vector \\(\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\) can have its unit vector expressed as\n\\(\\hat{a}=\\frac{\\mathbf{a}}{|\\mathbf{a}|}=\\frac{x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}}{|\\mathbf{a}|}=\\frac{x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\hat{a}=\\frac{x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\n\nGiven \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{i}+4\\mathbf{j}-9\\mathbf{k}\\), to find the unit vector \\(\\hat{p}\\), you find the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{p}\\):\n\\(|\\mathbf{p}|=\\sqrt{1^2+4^2+(-9)^2}\\).\nThen, using the tip from above, the unit vector is\n\\(\\hat{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{i}+4\\mathbf{j}-9\\mathbf{k}}{\\sqrt{1^2+4^2+(-9)^2}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{i}+4\\mathbf{j}-9\\mathbf{k}}{\\sqrt{98}}\\)\n\nWhich can be simplified to: \\(\\hat{p}=\\frac{1}{7\\sqrt{2}}\\mathbf{i}+\\frac{4}{7\\sqrt{2}}\\mathbf{j}-\\frac{9}{7\\sqrt{2}}\\mathbf{k}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\n\nGiven \\(\\mathbf{q}=-4\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}+11\\mathbf{k}\\), to find the unit vector \\(\\hat{q}\\), you find the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{q}\\),\n\\(|\\mathbf{q}|=\\sqrt{(-4)^2+2^2+11^2}=\\sqrt{141}\\).\nThen the \\(\\hat{q}=\\frac{-4\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}+11\\mathbf{k}}{\\sqrt{141}}=-\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{141}}\\mathbf{i}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{141}}\\mathbf{j}+\\frac{11}{\\sqrt{141}}\\mathbf{k}\\)"

    "text": "Laws of indices\nUsing indices is a way of writing something down. In mathematics you may want to use indices in other ways. For example, what do these expressions mean: \\(a^{-1}\\) or \\(a^0\\) or \\(a^{\\LARGE\\frac{1}{2}}\\) ?\nTo proceed further, you need to learn rules to operate with so you can find out what these notations mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 1: Multiplication\n\n\n\nIf the two terms have the same base (in this case \\(a\\)) and are multiplied together, then their indices are added (in this case \\(m+n\\))\n\\[a^m·a^n = a^{m+n}\\]\nFor example:\nSuppose you have \\(3^2\\) and you want to multiply it by \\(3^3\\). That is \\[3^2·3^3 = 3·3 \\ \\ ·\\ \\ 3·3·3 \\] which is equal to \\(3^5\\).\nTherefore, using Law 1 you can get \\[3^2·3^3 = 9·27 = 243 = 3^5 = 3^{2+3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nSimplify the following expression: \\(x^2y^3· x^3y^{-1}\\)\nYou can treat \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as two separate terms and you are now simplifying \\(x^2·x^3\\) and \\(y^3·y^{-1}\\). Using Law 1, you can add the indices to get: \\(x^{2+3}\\) and \\(y^{3+(-1)}\\). Remembering to multiply the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms, you then get \\[x^2y^3· x^3y^{-1} = x^{2+3}y^{3-1} = x^5y^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 2: Division\n\n\n\nIf the two terms have the same base (in this case \\(a\\)) and are to be divided, then their indices are subtracted (in this case \\(m-n\\))\n\\[\\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\] For example:\nSuppose you want to divide \\(2^5\\) by \\(2^3\\). \\[\\dfrac{2^5}{2^3} = \\dfrac{2·2·2·2·2}{2·2·2}\\] You can now cancel the common factors of \\(2\\). Three of the \\(2\\)’s at the bottom can be cancelled out, so you are left with \\[\\dfrac{2·2}{1} = 2^2 = 4\\] Therefore, you can get \\[\\dfrac{2^5}{2^3} = 4 = 2^2 = 2^{5-3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nSimplify the following expression: \\(\\dfrac{x^2y^3}{x^5y}\\)\nYou can treat \\(\\dfrac{x^2y^3}{x^5y}\\) as the product of two fractions: \\(\\dfrac{x^2}{x^5}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{y^3}{y}\\).\nUsing Law 2, you can simplify the fractions to get: \\(\\dfrac{x^2}{x^5} = x^{2-5} = x^{-3}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{y^3}{y} = y^{3-1} = y^2\\), remembering to multiply the fractions, you get \\[\\dfrac{x^2y^3}{x^5y} = x^{2-5}y^{3-1} = x^{-3}y^2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 3: Brackets\n\n\n\nTo raise a value or variable (in this case \\(a\\)) presented in index form to another index, multiply the indices together (\\(m\\) and \\(n\\)) \\[(a^m)^n = a^{m·n}\\] For example:\nSuppose you had \\(3^2\\) and you want to raise it all to the power of \\(3\\). That is \\[(3^2)^3\\] this means \\[3^2·3^2·3^2\\] Law 1 tells you to add the indices together. So you can get \\[3^6\\] But note that \\(6\\) is \\(2·3\\). This suggests that Law 3 also works. Therefore, using Law 3 you can get \\[(3^2)^3 = 729 = 3^6 = 3^{2·3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nSimplify the following expression: \\((x^2y^3)^4\\)\nUsing Law 3, you get \\[(x^2y^3)^4 = (x^2)^4·(y^3)^4 = x^{2·4}y^{3·4} = x^8y^{12}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 4: Power of \\(0\\)\n\n\n\nAnything to the power of zero is equal to one: \\[a^0 = 1\\]\nNote:\nAnything to the power of one is equal to itself \\[a^1 = a\\] and\n\\(1\\) to the power of anything is \\(1\\) \\[1^a=1\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\\(0^0\\) is indeterminate, anything to the power of \\(0\\) is \\(1\\), but \\(0\\) to the power of anything is \\(0\\), so it is not defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nSimplify the following expression: \\((x^2 + y^5)^0\\)\nUsing Law 4, you can get \\[(x^2 + y^5)^0 = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof of Law 4\n\n\n\nLaw 2 helps to explain Law 4:\nSince anything divided by itself is equal to one, so \\[\\dfrac{a^m}{a^m} = 1\\]\nAlso \\[\\dfrac{a^m}{a^m} = a^{m-m} = a^0 = 1\\] Therefore, \\[a^0 = 1\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 5: Negative indices\n\n\n\nIf the index is a negative value, then it can be shown as the reciprocal of the positive index raised to the same variable \\[a^{-m} = \\dfrac{1}{a^m}\\]\nFor example:\nSuppose you want to divide \\(2^3\\) by \\(2^7\\) \\[\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=\\dfrac{2·2·2}{2·2·2·2·2·2·2}\\] Again, you can find the common factors of \\(2\\). The three \\(2\\)’s at the top can be cancelled out, so you are left with \\[\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=\\dfrac{1}{2·2·2·2}=\\dfrac{1}{2^4}\\]\nNow consider Law 2, you can do the similar calculation by subtracting the indices \\[\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=2^{3-7}=2^{-4}\\] You have done the calculation in two different ways. So you get \\[\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=2^{3-4}=2^{-4}=\\dfrac{1}{2^4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nSimplify the following expression: \\((3x+4y)^{-1}\\)\nUsing Law 5, you can get \\[(3x+4y)^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{3x+4y}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw 6: Fractional indices\n\n\n\nAn index in the form of a fraction can be represented as the radical form:\n\\[a^{\\LARGE(\\frac{m}{n})}= (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m\\] For example:\nSuppose you found that \\[2^r·2^r=2\\] This means that multiplying \\(2^r\\) by \\(2^r\\) gives the result \\(2\\). So \\(2^r\\) is a square root of \\(2\\).\nNote that \\(2=2^1\\) and consider Law 1, \\(2^r·2^r=2^{2r}\\). If \\(2^r·2^r=2\\) then you can get \\[2^{2r}=2^1\\] from which \\[2r=1\\] so \\[r=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\] This shows that \\[2^{\\LARGE\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt[1]{2}=\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nSimplify \\(10000^{\\LARGE(\\frac{3}{4})}\\)\nUsing Law 7, you can re-express \\(10000^{\\LARGE(\\frac{3}{4})}\\) as \\((\\sqrt[4]{10000})^3\\), because \\(10^4=10000\\), \\(\\sqrt[4]{10000} = 10\\). So \\((\\sqrt[4]{10000})^3 = 10^3 = 1000\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nSimplify \\(27^{\\LARGE(\\frac{-2}{3})}\\)\nUsing Law 7, you can get \\(27^{\\LARGE(\\frac{-2}{3})} = (\\sqrt[3]{27})^{-2} = 3^{-2} = \\dfrac{1}{3^2} = \\dfrac{1}{9}\\)."

    "text": "What is the quadratic formula?\nOne of the most important types of an equation are quadratic equations; very generally speaking, these are equations that contain a squared term. These appear almost everywhere in mathematics, from modelling projectile motion in mechanics to describing circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in 2D space. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify and solve quadratic equations.\nThis guide will focus on solving quadratic equations in one variable by use of the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is an all-purpose way of finding solutions to any quadratic equation (unlike factorisation) and generally quicker than completing the square. Many examples are included in the guide, as well as a proof that the quadratic formula works for any quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quadratic formula\n\n\n\nLet \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) be a quadratic equation (where \\(a\\neq 0\\)). Then the roots to this quadratic equation are given by \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\] where one of the roots is given by the term \\((-b+\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})/2a\\) and the other given by the term \\((-b-\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})/2a\\).\n\n\nIf you have read Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations, you can recognize the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) in the square root.

    "text": "Using the quadratic formula\nHere are some examples of quadratic equations which are solved using the quadratic formula. To do this, you need to be able to identify the variable and the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\); something that was covered in Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations.\nThe first of these examples illustrates the importance of making sure the correct signs are inputted into the quadratic formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\)?\nHere, you could factorise the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) to get \\((x-2)(x-3) = 0\\). This is zero precisely when \\(x - 2 = 0\\) or \\(x - 3 = 0\\); so the roots are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).\nYou can also work this out using the quadratic formula. In this case, you’ll need to identify the values of \\(a,b,c\\) in the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\); here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\) and \\(c = 6\\). Taking care of the signs, you can put these into the quadratic formula and simplify to get \\[ x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{5\\pm 1}{2}\\] Therefore, the roots are \\(x = 4/2 = 2\\) and \\(x = 6/2 = 3\\), as was found above.\n\n\nThis next example illustrates the importance of the quadratic equation having \\(0\\) on one side in order to find the roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\)?\nIn order to use the quadratic formula, you need to first put the equation into the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). So rearranging \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\) to get zero on the left hand side gives \\[0 = x^2 + 8x + 16\\] So in this case, you can take \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 8\\) and \\(c = 16\\) and put these in the quadratic formula to get \\[ x = \\frac{-(8) \\pm \\sqrt{(8)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2}\\] In this case, the discriminant \\(D = 0\\) and so there is one distinct root that must be counted twice. Therefore, the roots are \\(x = -8/2 = -4\\) twice.\n\n\nThis next example is the first where \\(a \\neq 1\\); you should be prepared to solve any quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(4x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0\\)?\nThis equation is already in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives \\[ x = \\frac{-(4) \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2 - 4(4)(5)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 80}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8}\\] In this case, the discriminant \\(D &lt; 0\\). You can say that \\(\\sqrt{-64} = 8i\\), as \\(8\\) is the square root of \\(64\\) and \\(i\\) is the square root of \\(-1\\). This means that \\[x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8i}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\pm i\\] and these are the two roots of this quadratic equation.\n\n\nThe next example changes the name of the variable used. You should be able to recognise a quadratic equation in the wild, regardless of what symbol is used as the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(m^2 - m - 1 = 0\\)?\nHere, the quadratic equation is of the required form \\(am^2 + bm + c = 0\\) with \\(a = 1, b = -1\\) and \\(c = -1\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives: \\[ m = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - (-4)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\] Therefore, the two roots of the quadratic equation are \\(m = (1 -\\sqrt{5})/2\\) and \\(m = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2\\). (The second of these is a well-known mathematical constant known as the golden ratio)\n\n\nThe final two examples deal with changes of variable and also a change in the typical structure of a quadratic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the equation \\(y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 =0\\)?\nYou can notice here that the equation given is not strictly a quadratic equation, as it is not of the form given in the definition above. However, by taking \\(y^2\\) as the variable instead of \\(y\\), you can rewrite this equation as \\[y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 = (y^2)^2 - 3y^2 + 2 = 0\\] and so this is a quadratic equation, with \\(y^2\\) as the variable. You can then use the quadratic formula with \\(y^2\\) as the variable, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\) and \\(c = 2\\) to get \\[ y^2 = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 1}{2}\\] Therefore, the two solutions for \\(y^2\\) are \\(y^2 = 2/2 = 1\\) and \\(y^2 = 4/2 = 2\\). This gives four solutions for \\(y\\), which are \\(y = 1, -1, \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nWhat are the solutions to the equation \\(4q - 13 = -3/q\\)?\nYou can notice here that this equation does not look like a quadratic equation at all; so some rearranging needs to be done. First of all, you can multiply both sides by \\(q\\) to get \\[4q^2 - 13q = -3\\] and so \\[4q^2 - 13q + 3 = 0\\] So this really was a quadratic equation, with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = -13\\) and \\(c = 3\\). Putting this into the quadratic formula gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nq &= \\frac{-(-13) \\pm \\sqrt{(-13)^2 - 4(4)(3)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 48}}{8}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{8} = \\frac{13 \\pm 11}{8}\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the two solutions to the equation are \\(q = 2/8 = 1/4\\) and \\(q = 24/8 = 3\\).\n\n\nThe next two examples mirror Examples 5 and 6 in Guide: Introduction to quadratics, using the fact that you have already worked out the discriminant in these cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nIn Example 5 of Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations, you worked out the value of the discriminant \\(D\\) of the equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 16 + 64 = 80.\\] You can now work out what the two distinct real roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are by using the quadratic formula (with \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 4\\)): \\[x = \\frac{-4 \\pm\\sqrt{80}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 4\\sqrt{5}}{4} = -1 \\pm\\sqrt{5}\\] so \\(r_1 = -1+\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(r_2 = -1-\\sqrt{5}\\) are the two distinct real roots as promised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nIn Example 6 of Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations, you worked out the value of the discriminant \\(D\\) of the equation \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) to be \\[D = (-10)^2 - 4(1)(25) = 100 - 100 = 0.\\] Since \\(D = 0\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has at most one real root \\(r\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\). You can use the quadratic formula to work out how many real roots this quadratic equation has: \\[y^2 = \\frac{-(-10) \\pm\\sqrt{0}}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5.\\] Since \\(y^2 = 5\\), this equation has two real roots \\(y = \\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{-5}\\)."

The scalar product can tell you how much two vectors are aligned and can be used to find the angle between them.\nIt also has applications in applied mathematics and physics.\nThis guide will give both the algebraic and geometric definition of the scalar product, display certain properties of the operation and bring awareness to special cases that arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraic definition of the scalar product\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{u}= \\begin{pmatrix}u_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\u_n\\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} =\\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\v_n\\end{pmatrix}\\), then the scalar product, denoted \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\), is defined as follows:\n\\[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix}u_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\u_n\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\v_n\\end{pmatrix} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + ... + u_nv_n \\]\nThis may also be written, using sigma notation, as \\[\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum^n_{i=1}\\,u_i v_i\\]\n\n\nAs the name suggests, the scalar product of two vectors is a scalar.

The special cases in which they do not follow these conditions are dealt with below.\n\n\nHaving seen the geometric definition of the scalar product, you may now be wondering about where it comes from and its interpretation. You have the definitions, but how do these relate to the vectors you’re taking the scalar product of? Take two arbitrary vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Place their base at the same point. Call this base point A. Consider the plane formed by the tip of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) (at point B) and formed at the tip of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (at point C). The points A,B,C form a plane. Now, let a be the length of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), b be the length of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and c be the length of \\(\\mathbf{v-u}\\), like in the diagram below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Geometric interpretation of the Scalar Product, showing the vectors v and u and their difference and a triangle with the corresponding lengths.\n\n\nUsing trigonometry, the height of the triangle in figure 1 is \\(h=b\\sin(\\psi)\\). Looking at the diagram again, \\(l=b\\cos(\\psi)\\) and \\[x=a-l=a-b\\cos(\\psi)\\] Using Pythagoras’s theorem, \\[h^2+x^2=c^2\\] \\[b^2\\sin^2(\\psi)+(a-b\\cos(\\psi))^2=c^2=|\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{u}|^2\\] (the length of \\(\\mathbf{v}-\\mathbf{u})\\).

    "text": "What is a quadratic equation?\nOne of the most important types of an equation are quadratic equations; very generally speaking, these are equations that contain a squared term. These appear almost everywhere in mathematics, from modelling projectile motion in mechanics to describing circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in 2D space. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify and solve quadratic equations.\nThis guide will focus on quadratic equations in one variable, explain the shape of their graphs, and shows how to identify the variable and the coefficients of the equation. Then, the discriminant is defined, and the role of the discriminant in determining solutions to the quadratic equation is explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of quadratic equation, root\n\n\n\nA quadratic equation is an equation that can be rearranged into the form \\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\] where \\(x\\) is a variable and \\(a,b,c\\) are real numbers with \\(a \\neq 0\\).\nValues of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are known as roots of the equation. Typically, roots of a quadratic are expressed in the form of the variable. So here, the roots of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are ‘roots in \\(x\\)’.\n\n\nHere, \\(a\\neq 0\\) as if it was, then the equation would no longer be a quadratic equation!\nThe general shape of a quadratic equation is known as a parabola. A figure of two parabolas is given in Figure 1; the left hand graph is if \\(a &gt; 0\\), whereas the right hand graph is when \\(a &lt; 0\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\).\n\n\nIt is very important to be able to identify the variable in a quadratic equation, as well as the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\). In the course of your mathematical study, it may be that the variable of a quadratic equation is not only letters like \\(x,y,z\\), but squares or cubes like \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^3\\), or even functions like \\(e^x\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\), and \\(\\sin(y)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nYou are given the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nHere, the equation \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) may look like a quartic equation, but it is actually a quadratic equation. Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\((y^2)^2 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\). Therefore, the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(y^2\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -10\\), \\(c = 25\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\). Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\(-(e^{x})^2 + 4e^x - 5 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(e^x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = -1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -5\\). This is not the only solution to the coefficients; since the right-hand side is equal to \\(0\\), you can multiply the equation through by \\(-1\\) to get \\((e^{x})^2 - 4e^x + 5 = 0\\), which gives \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Both solutions are equally valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\). This really is a quadratic equation! You can multiply both sides by \\(x - 3\\) to get \\[(t+1)(t+3) = 4\\] You can then expand the brackets to get \\[t^2 + t + 3t + 3 = 4\\] and so \\(t^2 + 4t + 3 = 4\\). Finally, you are able to subtract \\(4\\) from both sides to get \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\). It follows that the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(t\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -1\\)."

See Figure 4 for a picture.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(D &gt; 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(D &lt; 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou can use the discriminant to check how many roots a quadratic equation has in the variable given to you. However, this is at most a maximum number of solutions. Conditions on that variable may also reduce the number of valid solutions, particularly if you have real valued functions. For instance, since \\(e^x &gt; 0\\) for all real number \\(x\\), there are no solutions in \\(x\\) if you find \\(e^x = -1\\).\n\n\nHere’s some examples of using the discriminant and known properties of functions to rule out solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nIn Example 1, you identified the coefficients of \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\) as \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 16 + 64 = 80.\\] Since \\(D = 80\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(x = r_1\\) and \\(x = r_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nIn Example 2, you identified the coefficients of \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) as \\(a = 1, b = -10, c = 25\\), and the variable as \\(y^2\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (-10)^2 - 4(1)(25) = 100 - 100 = 0.\\] Since \\(D = 0\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has at most one real root \\(r\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\).\nWhether or not the equation itself has real solutions in \\(y\\) depends on whether \\(r\\) is positive or negative! You cannot take the square root of a negative number, so if \\(r\\) is negative the equation has no real solutions. If \\(r\\) is positive, then the equation has two real roots in \\(y\\); that is, \\(y = \\pm\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nIn Example 3, you identified the coefficients of \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\) as \\(a = -1, b = 4, c = -5\\), and the variable as \\(e^{x}\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(-1)(-5) = 16 - 20 = -4.\\] Since \\(D = -4\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has complex roots.\nThis equation therefore has no real solutions in \\(x\\). This is because \\(e^x\\) is real for any real \\(x\\); if \\(e^x\\) is complex, it follows that \\(x\\) cannot be real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nIn Example 4, you rearranged the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\) to \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\), and therefore identified the coefficients as \\(a = 1, b = 4, c = -1\\), and the variable as \\(t\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.\\] Since \\(D = 20\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(t\\)."

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for incoming students to the School of Mathematics and Statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST.\n\n\n\nWhen writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are five main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey. In addition, using ‘we’ can be passive – if you want your reader to do mathematics, saying ‘we see this’ and ‘we deduce that’ may create a false sense of security.\nTherefore, the writing for this project will use the second-person singular ‘you’, with an emphasis on the active voice. Saying ‘you can do this’ rather than ‘we can see that’ helps to instill confidence in the reader, and actually shifts the focus to the reader doing mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour experiences with mathematics are unique, and will not be generally applicable to all students reading your work.

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for incoming students to the School of Mathematics and Statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST."

    "text": "When writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are five main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey. In addition, using ‘we’ can be passive – if you want your reader to do mathematics, saying ‘we see this’ and ‘we deduce that’ may create a false sense of security.\nTherefore, the writing for this project will use the second-person singular ‘you’, with an emphasis on the active voice. Saying ‘you can do this’ rather than ‘we can see that’ helps to instill confidence in the reader, and actually shifts the focus to the reader doing mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour experiences with mathematics are unique, and will not be generally applicable to all students reading your work. If you think that something is ‘easy’ or ‘obvious’, then good for you; but even mentioning this in your writing will crush the confidence of any student reading your work.\nSo nothing is easy. Not even things you learned in high school. Everyone has to start somewhere, and that somewhere might be here.
