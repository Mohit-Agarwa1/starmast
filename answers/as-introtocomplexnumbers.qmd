## Q1 {-}

Using complex numbers, find solutions to the following equations.

1.1. Here, $x = i$ and $x = -i$ are the two solutions. 

1.2. Here, $x = 3i$ and $x = -3i$ are the two solutions. 

1.3. Here, $x = 12i$ and $x = -12i$ are the two solutions. 

1.4. Here, $x = 1$ and $x = -1$ are the two solutions. (Real numbers are complex numbers too!)

## Q4 {-}


See @fig-1 for the Argand diagram. You can notice that the complex conjugates of the complex numbers can be obtained by reflecting the point in the real axis.
