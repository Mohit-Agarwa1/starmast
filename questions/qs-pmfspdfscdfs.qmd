# Questions: PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs

A selection of questions to test your understanding of Probability Mass Functions (PMFs), Probability Density Functions (PDFs), and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs).

## Before attempting these questions it is highly recommended that you read (Guide: PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs).

## Q1

For each of the scenarios below, determine if the given distribution is a valid PMF and answer the following questions.

**1.1**

Let $X$ be the random variable representing the result of rolling a biased four sided-dice. The PMF of $X$ is given by:

| $x$      | 1               | 2              | 3              | 4              |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| $P(X=x)$ | $\dfrac{1}{10}$ | $\dfrac{1}{5}$ | $\dfrac{1}{2}$ | $\dfrac{1}{5}$ |

a.  What is the probability of $X = 4$?

**1.2**

A random variable $X$ has five possible outcomes ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$, and the PMF is:

| $x$      | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4   | 5   |
|----------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| $P(X=x)$ | 0.25 | 0.35 | 0.05 | 0.2 | 0.1 |

a.  What is the probability of $X = 3$ or $X = 4$?

**1.3**

A coin is tossed, where the probability of tails is 70% and heads is 30%. Let $X$ represent the result of the coin toss. Complete the table below:

| $x$      | Heads | Tails |
|----------|-------|-------|
| $P(X=x)$ |       |       |

**1.4**

A random variable $X$ have the possible outcomes ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}$ with the following PMF:

| $x$      | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4   | 5    | 6    | 7    |
|----------|-----|------|------|-----|------|------|------|
| $P(X=x)$ | 0.1 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.3 | 0.25 | 0.75 | 0.35 |

a.  Is this a valid PMF? Why or why not?

**1.5**

A bag contains 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green sweets from a sweet shop. Let $X$ represent the color of a randomly picked sweet:

a.  What is the probability of picking a blue sweet?\
b.  Construct the PMF for this scenario by completing the table:

| $x$      | Red | Blue | Green |
|----------|-----|------|-------|
| $P(X=x)$ |     |      |       |

**1.6**

The PMF for a random variable $X$ is given as:

| $x$      | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|----------|-----|------|------|------|
| $P(X=x)$ | $p$ | $2p$ | $3p$ | $4p$ |

a.  For what value of $p$ is this a valid PMF?

b.  For this value of $p$, what is the probability of $X = 3$?

## Q2

For each of the scenarios below, determine if the given distribution is a valid PDF and answer the following questions.

**2.1**

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable on the interval $[0, 2]$ with the PDF:\
$$f(x) =\begin{cases} \dfrac{1}{2} & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 2 \\0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

a.  What is the probability that $X$ lies between 1 and 2?

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

a.  What is the probability that $X$ lies between 0.5 and 1?

b.  What is $P(0.25 > X > 0.75)$?

**2.3**

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable uniformly distributed between 3 and 7. The PDF is:

$$ f(x) =\begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if } 3 \leq x \leq 7 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

a.  What is the probability that $X$ lies between 3 and 6?

**2.4**

The PDF of a random variable $X$ is given by:

$$ f(x) =\begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{9} & \text{if } 1 \leq x \leq 4 \\\dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if } 5 \leq x \leq 7 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

a.  Is this a valid PDF? Why or why not?

**2.5**

Consider the PDF:

$$f(x) =
\begin{cases}
k x^2 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

a.  For what value of $k$ is this a valid PDF?

**2.6**

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
4x & \text{if } 0 \leq x < 0.5, \\
4 - 4x & \text{if } 0.5 \leq x < 0.75, \\
0.5 & \text{if } 0.75 \leq x \leq 1, \\
