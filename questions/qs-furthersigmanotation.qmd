*Before attempting these questions, it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to sigma notation](../studyguides/sigmanotation.qmd) and [Guide: Further sigma notation](../studyguides/furthersigmanotation.qmd).*

## Q1 {-}

Simplify the following double sums by writing them as products as sums and applying the properties of sums

4.1 $$\sum_{i=1}^{8}\sum_{j=3}^6 3ij^2$$

4.2 $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^k i(j+5)$$

## Q2 {-}

Express the following as double sums in their simplest possible form.

5.1 $$(3+9+27+81)(1+8+64)$$

5.2 $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(i+2)\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$$

5.3 $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(i+2)\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2$$

5.4 $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(i+2)\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i+9)$$

## Q3 {-}

Simplify the following:

6.1 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (i-1)(2i+1)$$

6.2 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i(i+3)(i+6)$$
